# README

## Frederick Bouldering
Open-source project documenting the bouldering (rock climbing) development in Frederick, Maryland.

## Behind The Scenes
I build this web application with Rails 5, HTML and CSS. I'm currently working on refactoring the styling and throwing in a few more changes to the UI. I want to change the focus of the application to emphasize media for each boulder problem.

## Contribution Guidelines
* Please post unobstructed photos of either the problem in full view or the problem being climbed.
* Add SubAreas within the correct MainAreas. Double check to ensure that the SubArea is not being duplicated.
* Contact me to submit a new MainArea.

## Access Issues
* Refrain from posting explicit directions or GPS coordinates for problems or areas with sensitive access
* Strip EXIF data from photos to help enforce this policy.
* Contact me for before posting if you are unclear about the access of any area.

## Currently Working On
* Refactor styling
* Refactor views - Ditch ERB and utilize YAML
* Comments
* Video embed - paste source url and choose which problems/areas are associated
* OAuth - Google / FB - streamline sign up process
* Implement JS to create image galleries
* Cover images for bproblem, sub_area and main_areas #show routes

## Why?
Resources & information regarding the climbing in Frederick is scattered across multiple platforms.
This is an attempt to house and organize the information in one place that will be available to those
interested in contributing to the development.

####Please submit a pull request if you find any bugs. I appreciate it in advance.
